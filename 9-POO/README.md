# Week 9 Overview

This week focuses on working with object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code in a more modular and reusable way.

## Topics Covered

- **Introduction to OOP**: Understanding the basics of object-oriented programming.
- **Classes and Objects**: Learning how to define and use classes and objects.
- **Inheritance**: Exploring how to create subclasses and inherit properties and methods.
- **Encapsulation**: Understanding how to protect data within classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Learning how to use methods in different ways across different classes.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of object-oriented programming and its benefits.
- Learn to define and use classes and objects in Python.
- Practice creating subclasses and using inheritance to extend functionality.
- Familiarize yourself with encapsulation and how to protect data within classes.
- Explore polymorphism and how to use methods in different contexts.

## Resources

- [Python OOP Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)

## Assignments

- Complete the problem sets provided in the course.
- Participate in the discussion forums to clarify doubts.

## Tips

- Practice writing classes and creating objects for different use cases.
- Use inheritance to extend the functionality of existing classes.
- Read the documentation to understand the full capabilities of OOP in Python.

Happy coding!
