# Playback Project

This project contains a simple Python script that replaces spaces in user input with ellipses (`...`).

## Description

The `playback.py` script reads a line of input from the user, replaces all spaces with ellipses (`...`), and prints the modified string. This can be useful for formatting text in a specific way or for fun text transformations.

## How to Use

To use the `playback.py` script, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `playback.py` script.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```sh
python playback.py
```

4. Enter the text you want to transform when prompted.
5. The script will output the transformed text with spaces replaced by ellipses.

Example:

```sh
$ python playback.py
Enter your text: Hello World
Hello...World
```
