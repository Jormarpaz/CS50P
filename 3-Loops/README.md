# Week 3: Loops

## Overview

This week focuses on understanding and implementing loops in Python. Loops are fundamental for performing repetitive tasks efficiently.

## Topics Covered

- **For Loops**: Iterating over sequences.
- **While Loops**: Executing code as long as a condition is true.
- **Nested Loops**: Using loops within loops.
- **Loop Control Statements**: `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the syntax and usage of `for` and `while` loops.
- Learn to control loop execution with `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.
- Practice writing nested loops for complex tasks.

## Resources

- [Python Loops Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements)

## Assignments

- Complete the problem sets provided in the course.
- Participate in the discussion forums to clarify doubts.

## Tips

- Practice writing loops with different conditions and ranges.
- Debug your loops by adding print statements to understand the flow.

Happy coding!
