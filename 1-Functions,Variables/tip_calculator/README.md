# Tip Calculator

This project is a simple tip calculator written in Python. It allows users to input the cost of a meal and the desired tip percentage, then calculates the tip amount.

## Description

The program consists of three main functions:

- `main()`: The entry point of the program. It prompts the user for the meal cost and tip percentage, calculates the tip, and prints the result.
- `dollars_to_float(d)`: Converts a string representing a dollar amount to a float.
- `percent_to_float(p)`: Converts a string representing a percentage to a float.

## How to Use

To use the tip calculator, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `tip.py` file.
3. Run the following command:

```sh
python tip.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the meal cost and desired tip percentage.
5. The program will display the calculated tip amount.

Example usage:

```sh
$ python tip.py
How much was the meal? $50
What percentage would you like to tip? 20%
Leave $10.00
```

This will calculate a 20% tip on a $50 meal, resulting in a $10.00 tip.
