# Interpreter

This project contains a Python script `interpreter.py` that interprets simple arithmetic expressions provided by the user and outputs the result.

## Description

The script `interpreter.py` prompts the user to input a simple arithmetic expression (e.g., "2 + 2"). It then evaluates the expression and prints the result. The script supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python interpreter.py
```

You will be prompted to enter an arithmetic expression. Based on your input, the script will evaluate the expression and print the result.

## Example

```sh
$ python interpreter.py
Enter an arithmetic expression: 2 + 2
4
```

```sh
$ python interpreter.py
Enter an arithmetic expression: 10 / 2
5.0
```

```sh
$ python interpreter.py
Enter an arithmetic expression: 3 * 3
9
```
