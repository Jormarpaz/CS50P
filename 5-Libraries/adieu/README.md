# Adieu Project

This project is part of the CS50P course, focusing on string manipulation and user input handling in Python. The goal is to format a list of names into a farewell message using proper grammar and punctuation.

## Description

The `adieu.py` script reads names from the user until an EOF (End of File) is encountered, then formats these names into a farewell message. The project demonstrates the use of string manipulation, user input handling, and the `inflect` library to achieve the correct formatting.
