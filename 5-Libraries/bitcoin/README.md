# Bitcoin Price Checker

This project is part of the CS50P course, focusing on using libraries in Python. The goal is to fetch the current price of Bitcoin and calculate the total cost for a given amount of Bitcoin.

## Description

The Bitcoin Price Checker reads the amount of Bitcoin from the user, fetches the current price from the CoinDesk API, and calculates the total cost. The project demonstrates the use of external libraries, API requests, and exception handling to achieve the price calculation.

## CLI Commands
