# CS50P Week 1: Functions and Variables

## Overview

This week, we focused on understanding the basics of functions and variables in Python. Below are the projects we worked on and their descriptions.

## Projects

### 1. Hello

**Description:** A simple program that prompts the user for their name and then greets them with a personalized message.

**How to use:** Run the program and enter your name when prompted. The program will then display a greeting message with your name.

### 2. Calculator

**Description:** A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

**How to use:** Run the program and follow the prompts to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The program will then display the result of the operation.

### 3. Temperature Converter

**Description:** Converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. The user inputs the temperature and the program outputs the converted value.

**How to use:** Run the program and enter the temperature you want to convert. Specify whether the input temperature is in Fahrenheit or Celsius. The program will then display the converted temperature.

### 4. BMI Calculator

**Description:** Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided height and weight.

**How to use:** Run the program and enter your height and weight when prompted. The program will then calculate and display your BMI.

### 5. Tip Calculator

**Description:** Helps users calculate the tip amount based on the total bill and the desired tip percentage.

**How to use:** Run the program and enter the total bill amount and the desired tip percentage. The program will then calculate and display the tip amount.

## Conclusion

These projects helped reinforce the concepts of functions and variables, providing a solid foundation for more complex programming tasks in the future.
