# Einstein.py

## Description

This project contains a simple Python script that calculates the energy equivalent of a given mass using Einstein's famous equation \(E = mc^2\). The script prompts the user to input a mass value and then computes the energy based on the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately \(3 \times 10^8\) meters per second).

## How to Use

To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python einstein.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a mass value, and the script will output the corresponding energy.
