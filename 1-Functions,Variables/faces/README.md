# Faces Project

This project is a simple Python script that converts emoticon faces in a given text to their corresponding Unicode emoji characters. Specifically, it converts `:)` to `🙂` and `:(` to `🙁`.

## How to Use

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `faces.py` script.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```sh
python faces.py
```

4. When prompted, enter a string containing `:)` or `:(` to see the conversion.

Example:

```sh
$ python faces.py
Hello :)
Hello 🙂
```
